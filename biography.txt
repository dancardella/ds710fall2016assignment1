Your first assignment is to use GitHub to submit some autobiographical information about yourself.  Answer the following questions.  Use GitHub to submit the resulting text file.

1. Dan Cardella

2. First, because it has direct applicability to my business of Asset (Money) Mngt
Secondly, because I look forward to having the skill-set necessary to investigate all of the Big Data that’s becoming available and 
Lastly, because I enjoy the aspects of being a master, computer/data craftsman !

3. My OOP experience relates primarily to Ruby and Rails (attended a 12 week boot camp training in 2012…CodeAcademy, Chicago) . I’ve recently begun coding in Python and R in preparation for this program. I probably have ~1500 total hours of MOOC, classroom training, and practice time. When I was younger, I used to code in BASIC (Apple IIE and yes, I just dated myself !)

4. I had statistics as part of my undergraduate curriculum and employed a bit of basic stats in my job as a Reservoir Engineer.

5.  I use Python and R tools to investigate finance / stock correlations with a bit of sample code loaded onto my GIT account.  

6.  I’ve chosen these languages as my principal tools of Data Science investigation and intend to develop as solid a foundation in them as possible. 

7. Thank you for helping me get up to data science coding speed !
